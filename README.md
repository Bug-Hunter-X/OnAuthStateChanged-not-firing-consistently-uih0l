# Firebase onAuthStateChanged Listener Issue

This repository demonstrates a problem where the Firebase `onAuthStateChanged` listener doesn't always trigger when a user signs in or out.  The issue appears intermittently, making it difficult to debug.

## Problem Description

The `onAuthStateChanged` listener is supposed to fire whenever the user's authentication state changes.  However, in this instance, it sometimes fails to fire, leading to unexpected behavior in the application.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install the necessary dependencies: `npm install`
3. Initialize Firebase (replace placeholders with your Firebase config).
4. Run the application.
5. Observe that the listener does not always update the UI correctly, showing inconsistencies in the authentication state.

## Solution

A potential fix (provided in `bugSolution.js`) involves ensuring proper cleanup of the listener using the `unsubscribe` function, which also involves handling potential errors during the unsubscribe process.  Additional investigation may be required to pinpoint the root cause of the intermittent behavior.
